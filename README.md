# ChatScout (or AttestPromptsScan)

A chat-gpt like interface for querying data on chain as a block explorer does and with the possibility of improve the knowledge of the model to get better prompts in a social graph made with attestations.

## Project Description

This project addresses two issues simultaneously: first, it aims to enhance the relevance of suggested prompts from AI tools like ChatGPT or Gemini; second, it seeks to create a blockchain explorer that can be queried using Web3 technologies in a manner similar to these AI tools. Additionally, the app features a social network component that allows users to interact with and share prompts with each other.

## How it's Made

ChatScout leverages Ethereum Attestation Service’s attestations and Blockscout’s APIs, combined with a large language model (LLM), to handle queries about a specific blockchain using natural language. Additionally, it includes a social network feature that enables users to interact with each other and share insights and prompts related to blockchain queries.
